// Replace these with your actual values
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");           // Your public key
'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',                         // Your service ID

\`\`\`

## Free Tier Limits

emailjs.sendForm('service_gmail123', 'template_contact456', contactForm);
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

**Form not sending?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all IDs are correct
- Make sure EmailJS script is loaded

**Not receiving emails?**
- Check spam folder
- Verify email service is connected
- Test with EmailJS dashboard

**Rate limit exceeded?**
- You've sent more than 200 emails this month
- Upgrade to paid plan or wait for next month

Your EmailJS public key is safe to expose in frontend code - it's designed for client-side use and has built-in rate limiting.
